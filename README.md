# dino-run
Chrome's iconic dino-run game, remade with Unity, and C#

This was made as a quick project because I was bored to death.
There are three objects in the Unity sceneâ€”the player, the obstacle, and the ground. To simulate infinite obstacle generation, you move the obstacle from one end of the screen to the other, and then after it's off screen, you move it back to the orginal spawn position. 

The speed of the obstacle also gradually increases with speed, with the power of couroutines, in C#.
